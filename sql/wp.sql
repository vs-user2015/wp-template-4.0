They''ve always come out when I''ve needed them and they are always very pleasant guys. Their prices are fine; they are certainly better than everybody I had before. I''d say go for it! \r\n</p>\r\n<p class="clients">- Jan S., Edmonton</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class="quotes-interior"><b>Wonderful company and a great product</b>\r\nWeathermakers LTD installed an AC and Furnace for me in the early spring. The technicians that performed the installation were very professional and knowledgeable. One of the guys had been a technician for 35 years and his junior had been a technician for about 20 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nI signed a club members service contract with Weathermakers. They came out in the spring to get the AC up and running and will be out soon for the heating. Weathermakers is a wonderful company with a great product. I purchased a higher quality product from them, and it has been living up to my expectations. I would recommend their service. \r\n</p>\r\n<p class="clients">- Rob C., Edmonton</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class="quotes-interior"><b>Wonderful</b>\r\nIt was a pleasant experience with Weathermakers Ltd. They installed a new furnace for us. It turned out well and everything''s fine. \r\n</p>\r\n<p class="clients">- Keith C., Edmonton</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class="quotes-interior"><b>Prompt, helpful, and courteous</b>\r\nI have been using them for two years. They were always helpful, courteous, and prompt. They delivered on what they said. I''ve never had an issue with their product. They deliver on their promises. They also have a good value for money. Their customer service is great. I have recommended them. \r\n</p>\r\n<p class="clients">- Linda L., Edmonton</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class="quotes-interior"><b>Very reliable, professional, and organized company</b>\r\nI have been very satisfied with Weathermakers. They are very reliable and professional. The staff is always very courteous and respectful of customers. They have done everything for us from plumbing to air conditioning and furnace work. They know what they''re doing, and working with them for the past four years has always been a pleasant experience. I would highly recommend them. \r\n</p>\r\n<p class="clients">- Nada C., Edmonton</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class="quotes-interior"><b>They are there 24-7! Rapid response time!</b>\r\nI have a care package with Weathermakers. We have had them install a furnace/air conditioning, fix a water heater and take care of a few emergency type situations. The thing I like most is how quickly they respond. They have people available 24-7. It does not matter if it is 3 am or 3 pm. When our furnace went out at 2 am when it was -40 degrees outside they were out right away. The technicians are always very professional and knowledgeable. I would not go with anybody else!\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="clients">- Bruce O., Saint Albert</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor a full list of customer testimonials and reviews, visit our <a href="https://www.customerlobby.com/reviews/27607/weathermakers-ltd/">Customer Lobby profile</a>. \r\n\r\n<em>Get Better Weather!</em>\r\n<h4>Call WeatherMakers at <b>780-266-3678 (780-COMFORT)</b> for on-time, professional heating, cooling, indoor air quality, and plumbing services, all backed by a gimmick-free 100% satisfaction guarantee!</h4>', 'Testimonials', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '8-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-09-29 14:06:13', '2016-09-29 14:06:13', '', 8, 'http://ceispokane.com/8-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Also known as an electrical panel, breaker box, load service or service panel, it is the steel box that acts as the main distribution point for the electrical circuits in your home. It provides a protective fuse (circuit breaker) for each circuit in one central location. Depending on the load demand, it generally provides between 100 to 200 amps of electricity. The power is fed into your home from the utility company through a service entrance. It then flows through an outdoor electrical meter, then through an electrical disconnect and into the main breaker in the breaker panel.</p>\r\n<h3>Does Your Home Have Enough Power?</h3>\r\n<p>A circuit breaker will trip (shut off) when there is an overloaded circuit, a short circuit or a ground fault. If you have been experiencing circuits that continuously trip after they have been reset, there may be insufficient power to run your home adequately. If your electrical system needs to be updated, your electrical panel is the first step in the process. You might just need an upgrade to your panel, which would allow more power from the utility into your home. There might be circuit breakers that need to be replaced because they are now obsolete or damaged. Or your electrical panel might be too small to efficiently run the wiring in your home. In this case, an electrician will need to replace the panel entirely – along with the existing meter to allow more power into your electrical system.</p>\r\n<h3>How Do I know If I Need to Replace my Electrical Panel?</h3>\r\n<p>Here are a few reasons that you might need to replace your electrical panel:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A typical lifespan for an electrical panel is 25 - 40 years. If yours is older than 40, you should consider a replacement.</li>\r\n<li>The circuit breakers trip on a regular basis.</li>\r\n<li>Lights dim when an appliance is turned on.</li>\r\n<li>There aren’t enough electrical outlets for your household needs.</li> \r\n<li>You are adding a high-powered appliance such as a central air system or washer and dryer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Professional Breaker Panel Replacement</h3>\r\n<p>The master electricians at Current Electrical are experts on breaker panels.

Also known as an electrical panel, breaker box, load service or service panel, it is the steel box that acts as the main distribution point for the electrical circuits in your home. It provides a protective fuse (circuit breaker) for each circuit in one central location. Depending on the load demand, it generally provides between 100 to 200 amps of electricity. The power is fed into your home from the utility company through a service entrance. It then flows through an outdoor electrical meter, then through an electrical disconnect and into the main breaker in the breaker panel.</p>\r\n<h3>Does Your Home Have Enough Power?</h3>\r\n<p>A circuit breaker will trip (shut off) when there is an overloaded circuit, a short circuit or a ground fault.

They happen quickly and are sometimes easy to miss. That slight power outage that happened when you started the sweeper? The blink-and-you-missed it flash in the kitchen when the toaster was plugged in? Those are power surges. There are more dangerous surges that come from lightning strikes and other factors, but all surges pose a serious threat to your home. Regardless of the origin, that surge through your wiring can have a big impact on your home’s appliances and electrical equipment. Surge protection devices (SPDs) are the best option against power surges that can harm and sometimes destroy appliances and electrical gadgets.</p>\r\n<h3>What Is Whole-House Surge Protection?</h3>\r\n<p>Some homeowners are under the misconception that a simple power strip or protective panel is adequate protection from a dangerous surge. But the only reliable option for protecting your home is a whole-house surge protection device. A whole-house SPD is connected to a home’s electrical panel, but usually installed in a more accessible location in the residence. While department store power strips can be destroyed after a powerful surge, whole-house SPD systems are designed to shunt large surges and last for several years. Many modern homes now come standard with SPD systems for added safety, but mainly new builds that include expensive electrical systems. </p>\r\n<h3>Reasons for Installing a Whole-House SPD</h3>\r\n<p>There are several reasons to install a whole-house surge protection device:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p><b>80% of Surges Come from Inside the Home</b> - Most power surges are transient (very short) and come directly from the generators and motors in common home appliances. Transient surges don’t cause major damage, but over time they can cumulatively degrade the performance and slowly decrease the lifespan of your computers, televisions, stereo equipment and major appliances plugged directly into an outlet.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><b>Electrical System Protection</b> - While the main function of a surge protection device is to protect your home’s appliances and electronics, it is also shielding the entire electrical system. This is one of the main reasons many new builds make them standard. When a transient surge is generated from an appliance (on a dedicated circuit), it will deflect the surge back through the electrical panel where it is quickly shunted. This action protects all of the other electrical equipment in the home.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><b>Modern Technology</b> - Society is driven by technology more than ever before. 68% of adults in the U.S. own a smart phone and half of the homes in the U.S. own an Apple product. Home computers, smart pads and other personal gadgets all contain essential information and need to be protected. Bank accounts, television viewing, texting and other vital connections could potentially be lost or negatively impacted through a surge. Modern appliances are also much more intelligent and include circuit boards, which can easily be compromised as well.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Layering Protection</h3>\r\n<p>If your home contains an elaborate electronic set-up such as a home theater or security system, you might consider layering your whole-house surge protection. Say a kitchen appliance in your home sends a surge through a shared circuit (one that’s not dedicated), then the other outlets could be compromised. A layered system is directly connected directly to the electrical panel - and at the point of use. A power conditioner with surge suppression is the best way to handle these shared circuits.

There are several benefits to adding these classic devices to your home interior, including lower utility bills. Once considered outdated, especially after central heat and air became an essential component in most U.S. homes, they have recently made a comeback. Now appreciated for both practical and aesthetic purposes, ceiling fans are smart additions to living rooms, bedrooms and even outdoor patios. Current Electric can help you with all of your repair, replacement and installation needs.</p>\r\n<h3>Complete Ceiling Fan Services </h3>\r\n<p>Whether you need a ceiling fan repaired, installed, adjusted or replaced, our master electricians have the tools and the experience to compete the job. We specialize in installation and can assist if you need ideas on placement or ceiling fan design. You can maximize the heating or cooling of your central air with ceiling fan installed in the right room. If your fan has stopped working or is making strange sounds, we can help you with repairs on most modern designs. We’ve been helping our Spokane neighbors with indoor and outdoor ceiling fans for over a decade!</p>\r\n<h3>Ceiling Fan Benefits</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p><b>Energy-Savings</b> – Ceiling fans don’t raise or lower the temperature in a home. But they are able to cool people using the wind chill principal: moving air helps to evaporate perspiration, which causes a person to feel cooler than the surrounding air. Ceiling fans also work with your central air conditioning, maximizing the cool air coming from your air ducts. You can set your thermostat several degrees higher and still feel comfortable by using a ceiling fan. Just turning up the thermostat a couple degrees higher can substantially reduce your monthly utility bill.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><b>Healthier IAQ</b> – A ceiling fan can help your home’s IAQ (indoor air quality), especially if you live in an older home or apartment without a modern central air system. A ceiling fan can help circulate stale air and keep the air moving, which is important in sustaining a healthy air space. Musty rooms with stale odors can greatly benefit from ceiling fans and open windows.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><b>Lighting</b> – Many modern ceiling fan designs include a lighting element. Depending on how much light a room warrants, a ceiling fan can also act as the main lighting source (with a center domed globe) or offer accent lighting (with branched lamps). There are many different configurations of light elements available. Designs with lights also allow you to use the fan and light element independently; allowing for maximum control and comfort. </p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><b>Heating</b> – Most ceiling fan designs are available with a “reverse” component that allows the blades to move in the opposite direction. When you reverse the rotation of the fan blades (sending them clockwise), the warm air that moves upward is redistributed throughout the room. A fan in reverse mode doesn’t blow air directly downward, so you don’t feel a breeze – just the warm air that would otherwise collect at the ceiling. This allows a homeowner to get more from their heating system (similar to how the fan works with the A/C).</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><b>Patio Comfort</b> – Ceiling fans help create cool outdoor spaces during the summer and promote outdoor socializing during the uncomfortable Spokane heat. They deter flies, mosquitoes and other insects, making them ideal for patio dining. Make sure that when shopping for an outdoor ceiling fan that it is UL-rated for wet or humid conditions to ensure they remain operational throughout the year.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Let us assist with all of your ceiling fan projects!

Now appreciated for both practical and aesthetic purposes, ceiling fans are smart additions to living rooms, bedrooms and even outdoor patios. Current Electric can help you with all of your repair, replacement and installation needs.</p>\r\n<h3>Complete Ceiling Fan Services </h3>\r\n<p>Whether you need a ceiling fan repaired, installed, adjusted or replaced, our master electricians have the tools and the experience to compete the job. We specialize in installation and can assist if you need ideas on placement or ceiling fan design. You can maximize the heating or cooling of your central air with ceiling fan installed in the right room. If your fan has stopped working or is making strange sounds, we can help you with repairs on most modern designs. We’ve been helping our Spokane neighbors with indoor and outdoor ceiling fans for over a decade!</p>\r\n<h3>Ceiling Fan Benefits</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p><b>Energy-Savings</b> – Ceiling fans don’t raise or lower the temperature in a home. But they are able to cool people using the wind chill principal: moving air helps to evaporate perspiration, which causes a person to feel cooler than the surrounding air. Ceiling fans also work with your central air conditioning, maximizing the cool air coming from your air ducts. You can set your thermostat several degrees higher and still feel comfortable by using a ceiling fan. Just turning up the thermostat a couple degrees higher can substantially reduce your monthly utility bill.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><b>Healthier IAQ</b> – A ceiling fan can help your home’s IAQ (indoor air quality), especially if you live in an older home or apartment without a modern central air system. A ceiling fan can help circulate stale air and keep the air moving, which is important in sustaining a healthy air space. Musty rooms with stale odors can greatly benefit from ceiling fans and open windows.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><b>Lighting</b> – Many modern ceiling fan designs include a lighting element. Depending on how much light a room warrants, a ceiling fan can also act as the main lighting source (with a center domed globe) or offer accent lighting (with branched lamps). There are many different configurations of light elements available. Designs with lights also allow you to use the fan and light element independently; allowing for maximum control and comfort. </p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><b>Heating</b> – Most ceiling fan designs are available with a “reverse” component that allows the blades to move in the opposite direction. When you reverse the rotation of the fan blades (sending them clockwise), the warm air that moves upward is redistributed throughout the room. A fan in reverse mode doesn’t blow air directly downward, so you don’t feel a breeze – just the warm air that would otherwise collect at the ceiling. This allows a homeowner to get more from their heating system (similar to how the fan works with the A/C).</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><b>Patio Comfort</b> – Ceiling fans help create cool outdoor spaces during the summer and promote outdoor socializing during the uncomfortable Spokane heat. They deter flies, mosquitoes and other insects, making them ideal for patio dining. Make sure that when shopping for an outdoor ceiling fan that it is UL-rated for wet or humid conditions to ensure they remain operational throughout the year.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Let us assist with all of your ceiling fan projects!

While we service many makes and models, we''re an authorized Generac "Elite" service dealer.  Our Technicians are fully trained and ready to work on both air and liquid cooled systems.\r\n<h3>Home Standby Generators</h3>\r\nWhy do you need a standby generator for your home?  A power outage, especially an unexpected weather-related outage can grow to be far more than just a minor annoyance.  Electric heating won''t work on a cold night, food must be prepared without power, food will spoil in a hot refrigerator, hot water tanks stop heating, and any emergency home medical equipment will cease to function.\r\n\r\nAdding a standby generator to home keeps your family safe in the case of an emergency outage and comfortable in the event of a minor outage.  As generators become ever more affordable, there''s even less reason to not have one installed in your home.\r\n\r\nTypical options range between automatic generators which will start immediately in the event of a grid outage, leaving you with only a moment of power-loss while everyone else must wait for line technicians to repair the outage.  Manual standby generators, on the other hand, will require manual activation, making them suitable for standard homes but unsuitable for situations where always-on power is necessary (homes with medical equipment, for instance).\r\n<h3>Emergency Insurance for Your Business</h3>\r\nWhat would happen if your business lost electricity for an extended period of time? Your entire workflow would be compromised. The computer system, essential electronics, lighting, central air and general security would be eliminated. A loss of hours could be extremely detrimental to your productivity; a loss of days could affect the bottom line. Don’t let a blackout hurt your business. Installing a backup generator will help ensure your office remains productive and competitive throughout an extended power outage. Current Electrical can assist with the installation, repair and service of a commercial backup generator.\r\n\r\nA commercial backup generator offers insurance in the case of a blackout. It can provide power for several days, allowing a business to continue to be productive and profitable. In areas where severe electrical storms and burnouts happen on a regular basis, it makes sense to look into a backup generator. A backup (or standby) generator restores power to your building automatically – whether or not you’re present. There’s no switch, ensuring an uninterrupted continuation of power at the proper voltage. Current Electrical can help you choose the ideal generator for your business or building needs. We’ve been keeping our Spokane neighbors connected and productive for over a decade!\r\n\r\nA commercial backup generator is a smart way to prevent extended power outages from affecting your bottom line. <b>The benefits of a whole house backup system include:</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Quick, efficient and automatic distribution of power.</li>\r\n 	<li>Peace of mind that essential information will not be lost.</li>\r\n 	<li>Uninterrupted use of electronics and heating and cooling systems.</li>\r\n 	<li>Maintaining office productivity and safety during blackouts.</li>\r\n 	<li>Protecting the electrical system from hazardous voltage fluctuations and surges when the power returns</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>When the next power outage hits your area, you’ll be glad you made the investment!

Also known as an electrical panel, breaker box, load service or service panel, it is the steel box that acts as the main distribution point for the electrical circuits in your home. It provides a protective fuse (circuit breaker) for each circuit in one central location. Depending on the load demand, it generally provides between 100 to 200 amps of electricity. The power is fed into your home from the utility company through a service entrance. It then flows through an outdoor electrical meter, then through an electrical disconnect and into the main breaker in the breaker panel.</p>\r\n<h3>Does Your Home Have Enough Power?</h3>\r\n<p>A circuit breaker will trip (shut off) when there is an overloaded circuit, a short circuit or a ground fault. If you have been experiencing circuits that continuously trip after they have been reset, there may be insufficient power to run your home adequately. If your electrical system needs to be updated, your electrical panel is the first step in the process. You might just need an upgrade to your panel, which would allow more power from the utility into your home. There might be circuit breakers that need to be replaced because they are now obsolete or damaged. Or your electrical panel might be too small to efficiently run the wiring in your home. In this case, an electrician will need to replace the panel entirely – along with the existing meter to allow more power into your electrical system.</p>\r\n<h3>How Do I know If I Need to Replace my Electrical Panel?</h3>\r\n<p>Here are a few reasons that you might need to replace your electrical panel:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A typical lifespan for an electrical panel is 25 - 40 years. If yours is older than 40, you should consider a replacement.</li>\r\n<li>The circuit breakers trip on a regular basis.</li>\r\n<li>Lights dim when an appliance is turned on.</li>\r\n<li>There aren’t enough electrical outlets for your household needs.</li> \r\n<li>You are adding a high-powered appliance such as a central air system or washer and dryer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Professional Breaker Panel Replacement</h3>\r\n<p>The master electricians at Current Electrical are experts on breaker panels.

They happen quickly and are sometimes easy to miss. That slight power outage that happened when you started the sweeper? The blink-and-you-missed it flash in the kitchen when the toaster was plugged in? Those are power surges. There are more dangerous surges that come from lightning strikes and other factors, but all surges pose a serious threat to your home. Regardless of the origin, that surge through your wiring can have a big impact on your home’s appliances and electrical equipment. Surge protection devices (SPDs) are the best option against power surges that can harm and sometimes destroy appliances and electrical gadgets.</p>\r\n<h3>What Is Whole-House Surge Protection?</h3>\r\n<p>Some homeowners are under the misconception that a simple power strip or protective panel is adequate protection from a dangerous surge. But the only reliable option for protecting your home is a whole-house surge protection device. A whole-house SPD is connected to a home’s electrical panel, but usually installed in a more accessible location in the residence. While department store power strips can be destroyed after a powerful surge, whole-house SPD systems are designed to shunt large surges and last for several years. Many modern homes now come standard with SPD systems for added safety, but mainly new builds that include expensive electrical systems. </p>\r\n<h3>Reasons for Installing a Whole-House SPD</h3>\r\n<p>There are several reasons to install a whole-house surge protection device:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p><b>80% of Surges Come from Inside the Home</b> - Most power surges are transient (very short) and come directly from the generators and motors in common home appliances. Transient surges don’t cause major damage, but over time they can cumulatively degrade the performance and slowly decrease the lifespan of your computers, televisions, stereo equipment and major appliances plugged directly into an outlet.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><b>Electrical System Protection</b> - While the main function of a surge protection device is to protect your home’s appliances and electronics, it is also shielding the entire electrical system. This is one of the main reasons many new builds make them standard. When a transient surge is generated from an appliance (on a dedicated circuit), it will deflect the surge back through the electrical panel where it is quickly shunted. This action protects all of the other electrical equipment in the home.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><b>Modern Technology</b> - Society is driven by technology more than ever before. 68% of adults in the U.S. own a smart phone and half of the homes in the U.S. own an Apple product. Home computers, smart pads and other personal gadgets all contain essential information and need to be protected. Bank accounts, television viewing, texting and other vital connections could potentially be lost or negatively impacted through a surge. Modern appliances are also much more intelligent and include circuit boards, which can easily be compromised as well.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Layering Protection</h3>\r\n<p>If your home contains an elaborate electronic set-up such as a home theater or security system, you might consider layering your whole-house surge protection. Say a kitchen appliance in your home sends a surge through a shared circuit (one that’s not dedicated), then the other outlets could be compromised. A layered system is directly connected directly to the electrical panel - and at the point of use. A power conditioner with surge suppression is the best way to handle these shared circuits. A Current Electrical master electrician can take through the process and help you decide if layering is right for your home. </p>\r\n<h4>Keep your electronics and appliances safe with whole-home surge protection from Current Electrical.

There are several benefits to adding these classic devices to your home interior, including lower utility bills. Once considered outdated, especially after central heat and air became an essential component in most U.S. homes, they have recently made a comeback. Now appreciated for both practical and aesthetic purposes, ceiling fans are smart additions to living rooms, bedrooms and even outdoor patios. Current Electric can help you with all of your repair, replacement and installation needs.</p>\r\n<h3>Complete Ceiling Fan Services </h3>\r\n<p>Whether you need a ceiling fan repaired, installed, adjusted or replaced, our master electricians have the tools and the experience to compete the job. We specialize in installation and can assist if you need ideas on placement or ceiling fan design. You can maximize the heating or cooling of your central air with ceiling fan installed in the right room. If your fan has stopped working or is making strange sounds, we can help you with repairs on most modern designs. We’ve been helping our Spokane neighbors with indoor and outdoor ceiling fans for over a decade!</p>\r\n<h3>Ceiling Fan Benefits</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p><b>Energy-Savings</b> – Ceiling fans don’t raise or lower the temperature in a home. But they are able to cool people using the wind chill principal: moving air helps to evaporate perspiration, which causes a person to feel cooler than the surrounding air. Ceiling fans also work with your central air conditioning, maximizing the cool air coming from your air ducts. You can set your thermostat several degrees higher and still feel comfortable by using a ceiling fan. Just turning up the thermostat a couple degrees higher can substantially reduce your monthly utility bill.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><b>Healthier IAQ</b> – A ceiling fan can help your home’s IAQ (indoor air quality), especially if you live in an older home or apartment without a modern central air system. A ceiling fan can help circulate stale air and keep the air moving, which is important in sustaining a healthy air space. Musty rooms with stale odors can greatly benefit from ceiling fans and open windows.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><b>Lighting</b> – Many modern ceiling fan designs include a lighting element. Depending on how much light a room warrants, a ceiling fan can also act as the main lighting source (with a center domed globe) or offer accent lighting (with branched lamps). There are many different configurations of light elements available. Designs with lights also allow you to use the fan and light element independently; allowing for maximum control and comfort. </p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><b>Heating</b> – Most ceiling fan designs are available with a “reverse” component that allows the blades to move in the opposite direction. When you reverse the rotation of the fan blades (sending them clockwise), the warm air that moves upward is redistributed throughout the room. A fan in reverse mode doesn’t blow air directly downward, so you don’t feel a breeze – just the warm air that would otherwise collect at the ceiling. This allows a homeowner to get more from their heating system (similar to how the fan works with the A/C).</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><b>Patio Comfort</b> – Ceiling fans help create cool outdoor spaces during the summer and promote outdoor socializing during the uncomfortable Spokane heat. They deter flies, mosquitoes and other insects, making them ideal for patio dining. Make sure that when shopping for an outdoor ceiling fan that it is UL-rated for wet or humid conditions to ensure they remain operational throughout the year.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Let us assist with all of your ceiling fan projects!

Your entire workflow would be compromised. The computer system, essential electronics, lighting, central air and general security would be eliminated. A loss of hours could be extremely detrimental to your productivity; a loss of days could affect the bottom line. Don’t let a blackout hurt your business. Installing a backup generator will help ensure your office remains productive and competitive throughout an extended power outage. Current Electrical can assist with the installation, repair and service of a commercial backup generator. </p>\r\n<h3>Emergency Insurance for Your Business</h3>\r\n<p>A commercial backup generator offers insurance in the case of a blackout. It can provide power for several days, allowing a business to continue to be productive and profitable. In areas where severe electrical storms and burnouts happen on a regular basis, it makes sense to look into a backup generator. A backup (or standby) generator restores power to your building automatically – whether or not you’re present. There’s no switch, ensuring an uninterrupted continuation of power at the proper voltage. Current Electrical can help you choose the ideal generator for your business or building needs. We’ve been keeping our Spokane neighbors connected and productive for over a decade!</p>\r\n<p>A commercial backup generator is a smart way to prevent extended power outages from affecting your bottom line. <b>The benefits of a whole house backup system include:</b></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Quick, efficient and automatic distribution of power.</li>\r\n<li>Peace of mind that essential information will not be lost. </li>\r\n<li>Uninterrupted use of electronics and heating and cooling systems.</li>\r\n<li>Maintaining office productivity and safety during blackouts.</li>\r\n<li>Protecting the electrical system from hazardous voltage fluctuations and surges when the power returns</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>When the next power outage hits your area, you’ll be glad you made the investment!

While we service many makes and models, we''re an authorized Generac "Elite" service dealer.  Our Technicians are fully trained and ready to work on both air and liquid cooled systems.\r\n<h3>Home Standby Generators</h3>\r\nWhy do you need a standby generator for your home?  A power outage, especially an unexpected weather-related outage can grow to be far more than just a minor annoyance.  Electric heating won''t work on a cold night, food must be prepared without power, food will spoil in a hot refrigerator, hot water tanks stop heating, and any emergency home medical equipment will cease to function.\r\n\r\nAdding a standby generator to home keeps your family safe in the case of an emergency outage and comfortable in the event of a minor outage.  As generators become ever more affordable, there''s even less reason to not have one installed in your home.\r\n\r\nTypical options range between automatic generators which will start immediately in the event of a grid outage, leaving you with only a moment of power-loss while everyone else must wait for line technicians to repair the outage.  Manual standby generators, on the other hand, will require manual activation, making them suitable for standard homes but unsuitable for situations where always-on power is necessary (homes with medical equipment, for instance).\r\n<h3>Emergency Insurance for Your Business</h3>\r\nWhat would happen if your business lost electricity for an extended period of time? Your entire workflow would be compromised. The computer system, essential electronics, lighting, central air and general security would be eliminated. A loss of hours could be extremely detrimental to your productivity; a loss of days could affect the bottom line. Don’t let a blackout hurt your business. Installing a backup generator will help ensure your office remains productive and competitive throughout an extended power outage. Current Electrical can assist with the installation, repair and service of a commercial backup generator.\r\n\r\nA commercial backup generator offers insurance in the case of a blackout. It can provide power for several days, allowing a business to continue to be productive and profitable. In areas where severe electrical storms and burnouts happen on a regular basis, it makes sense to look into a backup generator. A backup (or standby) generator restores power to your building automatically – whether or not you’re present. There’s no switch, ensuring an uninterrupted continuation of power at the proper voltage. Current Electrical can help you choose the ideal generator for your business or building needs. We’ve been keeping our Spokane neighbors connected and productive for over a decade!\r\n\r\nA commercial backup generator is a smart way to prevent extended power outages from affecting your bottom line. <b>The benefits of a whole house backup system include:</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Quick, efficient and automatic distribution of power.</li>\r\n 	<li>Peace of mind that essential information will not be lost.</li>\r\n 	<li>Uninterrupted use of electronics and heating and cooling systems.</li>\r\n 	<li>Maintaining office productivity and safety during blackouts.</li>\r\n 	<li>Protecting the electrical system from hazardous voltage fluctuations and surges when the power returns</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>When the next power outage hits your area, you’ll be glad you made the investment!

Current Electrical can assist with the installation, repair and service of a commercial backup generator.\r\n\r\nA commercial backup generator offers insurance in the case of a blackout. It can provide power for several days, allowing a business to continue to be productive and profitable. In areas where severe electrical storms and burnouts happen on a regular basis, it makes sense to look into a backup generator. A backup (or standby) generator restores power to your building automatically – whether or not you’re present. There’s no switch, ensuring an uninterrupted continuation of power at the proper voltage. Current Electrical can help you choose the ideal generator for your business or building needs. We’ve been keeping our Spokane neighbors connected and productive for over a decade!\r\n\r\nA commercial backup generator is a smart way to prevent extended power outages from affecting your bottom line. <b>The benefits of a whole house backup system include:</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Quick, efficient and automatic distribution of power.</li>\r\n 	<li>Peace of mind that essential information will not be lost.</li>\r\n 	<li>Uninterrupted use of electronics and heating and cooling systems.</li>\r\n 	<li>Maintaining office productivity and safety during blackouts.</li>\r\n 	<li>Protecting the electrical system from hazardous voltage fluctuations and surges when the power returns</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>When the next power outage hits your area, you’ll be glad you made the investment!
